Files can be Geotiff or Netcdf

The nercdf files can come from acolite output

Netcdf files can be subset already

Models handles the file formats. They define how the data can be accessed.

Controllers handle getting the data from the models.

Other applications eg

cloud_pixels
water_pixels
ice_pixels
cloud_shadow_pixels

... handle how the data (or bands) is used to do some analysis.

Folder structure... path/row/scene/ then just use the filename... ie. the tiff files, the netcdf file the single netcdf files.

Take 199 024 2013280 as the reference...
Can extract BQA band from lat lon values in the singl netcdf...


Actually need to be able to subset the scenes...
Downsample scenes...

Convert DN numbers in tiff files to rtoa and then atmospheric correction.

## Structure

- models.py the code for accessing the netcdf files and getting a variable.
- bands.py - this is where the functions to access the bands from the netcdf files are.
- pixel_indentification.py - calculate indexes like ndvi and ndsi, do tests to identify things. Makes a mask for clouds, water, ice/snow.
